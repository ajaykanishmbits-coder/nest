			<p><b><i>Cloud services provide on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet, without the need to own or maintain physical hardware. They allow individuals and organizations to scale resources up or down quickly based on need, pay only for what they use, and access systems from anywhere with an internet connection. By shifting infrastructure management to cloud providers, businesses can focus more on innovation and core activities while benefiting from improved reliability, security, and faster deployment of applications.</i></b></p>
