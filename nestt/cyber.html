            <p><b>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It involves using tools such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, along with safe user practices, to keep digital information secure. As more personal and business activities move online, cybersecurity has become essential to protect sensitive data and maintain trust in digital systems. In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity plays a critical role in safeguarding organizations from cyber threats like hacking, phishing, and ransomware. A strong cybersecurity strategy helps prevent financial losses, protects customer information, and ensures the smooth operation of systems. Cybersecurity is not only a technical issue but also a shared responsibility among users, businesses, and governments. As cyber threats continue to evolve, security measures must adapt through advanced technologies and continuous learning. Building a strong cybersecurity culture helps reduce risks and supports a safer digital environment for everyone.</b></p>
